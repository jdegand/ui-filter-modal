<h1 align="center">UI Design Daily - #1569 Filter Modal</h1>

## Overview

![](filter-modal-mobile.png)
  
UI Design Daily design translated to real code.  I was going to make a central repo for any UI Design Daily designs I converted but I do not know how many I will do (etc) so I will just preface any ui-design-daily repos with ui.   

Design is responsive but not totally perfect.
