UI Design Daily design translated to real code.  I was going to make a central repo for any UI Design Daily designs I converted but I do not know how many I will do (etc) so I will just preface any ui-design-daily repos with ui.   

Design is responsive but not totally perfect.  

UI Design Daily website was down for a while (Feb - March 22).  Design can be found [here](https://www.uidesigndaily.com/posts/figma-filter-modal-day-1569).

[Filter Modal Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/17694430-Filter-Modal-UI-Design) can be found on dribble along with [all other ui design daily designs](https://dribbble.com/ildiesign).
